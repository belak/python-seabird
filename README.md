# seabird

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/belak/python-seabird.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/belak/python-seabird)

AKA the bot formerly known as the bot formerly known as seabird

## Goals

* Simple framework
* Clean code
* Only stdlib in core (irc portion)

## Setup

Required dependencies for core:

* python3.5 or greater

Install python plugin dependencies:

* pip install -r requirements.txt

The default distribution of seabird needs to be configured before it will do
anything. It will import the config module. The simplest option is to copy the
sample file provided at [config.dist.py](config.dist.py) to config.py, though
the important settings are outlined below:

### Running seabird

seabird can be run with the command `python -m seabird`

## asyncio

In order to start background processing, simply grab the event loop and add a
task. Events will be processed one at a time, but when you create a task it will
fall back to the main event loop. This allows IRC messages to be processed in
the order they come in, but still makes it possible to move time consuming
operations into the background.

As an example:

``` python
async def callback(msg):
    print('do a thing')

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.create_task(callback(msg))
```
